# PatchGirl

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/patchgirl/patchgirl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/patchgirl/patchgirl)
[![GitHub CI](https://github.com/patchgirl/patchgirl/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/patchgirl/patchgirl/actions)

A postman/postwoman like, web app to test your APIs !

## How to use

To use PatchGirl, you only need to go to the [app page 🚀](https://patchgirl.io).
However, for a full experience, you will want to run **patchgirl-runner** on your computer. It acts as a tiny proxy that runs your request (HTTP, SQL,...) from you computer.

## Installing Patchgirl-runner

### Linux

Just download the latest binary for linux [here](https://github.com/patchgirl/patchgirl/releases) and run it:

```bash
chmod +x patchgirl-runner-X.Y.Z
./patchgirl-runner-X.Y.Z
```

### MacOS

Either download and run the mac binary from the release (cf Linux section) or use homebrew:

```bash
brew install patchgirl/patchgirl/runner
patchgirl-runner # to run patchgirl-runner
```

nb: Please note that for recent versions of MacOS, if you use the binary method, MacOS will display an error popup stating that the app hasn't been recognized and so is insecure.
To overcome this issue, you'll need to "right-click open" the executable from the finder once!

### Windows

Windows support is currently on the roadmap.

📢 Scenario of tests

Play multiple requests one after another. This is useful if you want to:
- Automate your development environment db (eg: create many users,...)
- Automate the test of your API (eg: create a user then show it then delete it)

📜 pre-request script

Run a javascript script right before a request is executed. This is useful if you want to:
 - Include timestamp in the request headers
 - Send a random string in the URL parameters

📜 post-request script

Run a javascript script after a request is executed. This is useful if you want to:
 - Assert for a response status or body
 - Set variables according on the response body

📦 Desktop app (AKA *patchgirl runner*)

Install a desktop app so you can use PatchGirl locally. This is needed when you:
- Use PatchGirl without internet access
- Call localhost url
- Need to play any request that is not HTTP (i.e: Postgresql, MySQL,...)
- want faster request execution (no round trips to a remote server, everything is done on your computer)

## How to build

Please refer to the [documentation](/documentation) if you need to build and run PatchGirl locally.

## Architecture

![architecture](architecture_schema.svg)

PatchGirl is only built with functional programing languages:
- **NixOS** for the operating system
- **Haskell** for the backend API
- **Elm** for the front end single page app
- **Dhall** for everything related to configuration
