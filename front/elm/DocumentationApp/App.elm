If you have variable `userId` set in your environment or in a script, you can use it in any text input with the syntax `{{userId}}`

## Limitations

Due to browser restrictions (cf: [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) and [same origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Security/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript)), PatchGirl cannot run from your computer.
Instead, every requests you make are being sent from our servers which means that you can't by default query local hosts (i.e: `127.0.0.1`) or use your personnal VPN/Proxy.

To overcome this issue, you need to download and run [**PatchGirl Runner**](https://github.com/patchgirl/patchgirl/releases) (only available for Linux and MacOS at the time) which runs on your computer and allows you to run HTTP requests from your device.

You can add a script right before and/or just after every scene execution. This might come in handy if you need to override a variable before executing a request or if you need to test the response of a scene.

# PatchGirl Runner

The **PatchGirl runner app** (that you can [download](https://github.com/patchgirl/patchgirl/releases/) here) allows http requests and scenarios to be run from your computer instead of from our servers.
This is quite useful if you need to:
- query a local host (i.e: *127.0.0.1*)
- query a host through a VPN/Proxy you've defined on your computer

## Available platforms

As of today, the PatchGirl runner app is only available on Linux and MacOS. We plan to make it available on Windows as well soon enough.

## How to use

Installation is quite easy because the PatchGirl runner app is a standalone executable. After downloading it, you only need to run it:

```bash
chmod +x ./linux-x86-64-patchgirl-runner-exe
./linux-x86-64-patchgirl-runner-exe
```

Once it is running you should see 2 green arrows appearing in the [UI](https://patchgirl.io/#app/scenario) in the top right hand corner.
This means that PatchGirl Runner is enabled and that you can play all kinds of requests (HTTP, SQL, scenarios...) straight from your computer.

# Tangoscript

Tangoscript is a small scripting language that will help you interact with scenario. It main purpose is to get and parse results (HTTP response, SQL response,...) store local or global variables to reuse them accross a scenario.

## Set local variables

Local variables are variables that lives accross a single scene. You can instantiate a variables in a prescript and use it in its postscript.
Local variables can be set with the syntax:

```tangoscript
var foo = 1;
```

Local variables can be used in the input of a scene with the mustache syntax:

```
http://domain.com/users/{{foo}}
```

## Set global variables

Global variables lives accross an entire scenario.
e.g: given a scenario composed of 3 HTTP requests. If you define a global variable in the first HTTP request, it can be used in the last HTTP request as well.

Global variables can be set with the syntax:

```tangoscript
set("foo", 1);
```

Global variables can be used in a script with the syntax:

```tangoscript
fetch("foo");
```

Global variables can be used in the input of a scene with the mustache syntax:

```
http://domain.com/users/{{foo}}
```

## Assertion

Assertions are useful when you want to make sure some data is equal or not to an expected result.
Assertions can be used with the syntax:

```tangoscript
assertEqual(a, b);
assertNotEqual(a, b);
```

Note that `a` and `b` must be of the same type to make assertEqual succeeds.
If an `assertEqual` fails, all following scenes of a scenario won't be played.

## Accessing a scene response

Tangoscript make it easy to access a scene response by providing functions. Note that these functions are only available in the scene's postscript.
If you wish to make a response available everywhere, you can store it in a global variable.

### HTTP response

In an HTTP post script, the following functions are available:

```tangoscript
httpResponseBodyAsString // returns the response body as a string
httpResponseBodyAsJson // returns the response body as a json object
httpResponseStatus // returns the response status as an int
```

So if you want to check that the response succeeded you can write:

```tangoscript
assertEqual(httpResponseStatus, 200);
```

Or maybe you need to access some element of your response:

```tangoscript
var name = httpResponseBodyAsJson["user"]["firstname"];
```

### Postgres response

In an Postgres SQL post script, the following functions are available:

```tangoscript
// returns the response as a raw array without the table headers
postgresResponseAsArray
// returns the response and makes it easier to access a particular field
postgresResponse
```

Given the SQL query:

```SQL
select 1 as id, 'john' as name;
```
They can be used like this:

```tangoscript
assertEqual(postgresResponseAsArray[0], [1,"john"]);
assertEqual(postgresResponse[0]["id"], 1);
```
